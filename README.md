# ansible-hacking
A collection of scripts to make hacking on Ansible easier.

# Common
Scripts for use on any Ansible control machine.

## bootstrap.sh
Set up your environment with everything you need to develop and test Ansible.
On Linux, Python modules are installed using your choice of OS packages or pip.
On OS X, installation is done using a combination of
[brewdo](https://github.com/zigg/brewdo) or brew and pip.
The following platforms are currently supported, with the tested versions listed.
  * Ubuntu (14.04+)
    * 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr)
    * 15.04 (Vivid Vervet)
    * 15.10 (Wily Werewolf)
  * Debian (7+)
    * 7 (Wheezy) (pip only)
    * 8 (Jessie)
  * Fedora
    * 20

  * OS X (10.9+)
    * 10.9 (Mavericks)
    * 10.10 (Yosemite)
    * 10.11 (El Capitan)

Some platform versions have Python modules which are too old.
When this is the case, only the pip command will be available.

NOTE: This script must be run as root, except when using brew.
